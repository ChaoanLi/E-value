Visualizing Multiple Testing Methods: An Analysis Based on "A Note on E-values and Multiple Testing" (Li & Zhang, 2024)
This repository contains Python code for visualizing and comparing the performance of different statistical testing methods, inspired by the work of G. Li and X. Zhang in their paper "A Note on E-values and Multiple Testing" (Biometrika, to appear, 2024). The paper can be accessed here.

Overview
In this project, we replicate and extend the analysis of multiple testing methods presented in the paper. The focus is on understanding how different tests perform under various conditions and comparing their effectiveness through visualizations. The analysis includes comparisons of traditional p-values, E-values, and other statistical metrics across simulated datasets.
